We experimented with the creation of an augmented tour of the Auguste Gate in collaboration with the City of Nîmes.

The public is invited to explore the site with the _Reveality_ app to bring Vivien Barrière to life, a tour guide sharing anecdotes about the gate's history.

The tour is enhanced with sound content and archival images directly accessible through the app.

The experience was produced in a remarkably short timeframe of 6 hours (including writing and production) thanks to the post-production tools provided by Reveality, which enabled us to capture on-site content using a simple smartphone (see photos).

## The project will be publicly presented for the Heritage Days 2023.
