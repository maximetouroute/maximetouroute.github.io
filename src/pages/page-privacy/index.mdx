# Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: April 16, 2022_

When you use Reveality, you’ll share some information with us.

Your privacy is critically important to us. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the controls we give you to access,
update, and delete your information.

To that end, we have a few fundamental principles:

- We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to
  provide and the personal information that we collect about you through
  the operation of our services.
- We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
- We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what
  information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private),
  indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
- We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
- We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.

Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just [contact us](mailto:contact@reveality.io).

## Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

Welcome to Reveality!

We are the folks behind a suite of Augmented Reality (AR) and Extended Reality (XR) content creation tools that empower anyone — from newbies new to AR to XR creative studios, digital artists and independent content creators — to access the full potential of augmented reality and take full advantage of the power and creative richness it offers. We are convinced that AR can become a medium in its own right, a new form of expression, in the same way as cinema. Our mission is to democratize and simplify creation in AR, allowing creators to stay focused on the creative process and the message, without having to worry about technical considerations.

This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use our tools and our website.

This Privacy Policy also applies to information we collect
when you apply for a job at Reveality.
Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our website, mobile
applications, and other products and services collectively as
“Services.”
Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you,
along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.

## Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason
to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with
you, or to make our Services better.

There are three basic categories of information we collect:

- **Information you provide to us.**
- **Information we get automatically when you use our services.**
- **Information we get from third parties.**

Let’s go over the information that we collect.

### Information you provide to us

When you interact with our services, we collect information that you provide to us. Here are some examples:

- **Basic account information:** We ask for basic
  information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we
  require individuals who sign up for an account to provide
  an email address and password, along with a username or name — and
  that’s it. You may provide us with more information but we don’t require that
  information to create a Reveality account.
- **Public profile information:** If you have an account
  with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public
  profile. For example your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or an “About Me” description. Your public profile information is just that — public — so please keep
  that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
- **Content information:** Of course, you may also provide us whatever information you upload and send through our services, such as Holos, Mixes, Posts and comments that might include biographic information about you. Keep in mind that the users who view your published content can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to our services as well: Don’t post or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.
- **Communications with us (hi there!):** You may also
  provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate
  with our team about a support question, or sign up for a newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, or otherwise, we collect whatever information you volunteer or that we need to resolve your question.
- **Job applicant information:** If you apply for a job
  with us — awesome! You may provide us with information like your name,
  contact information, resume or CV, and work authorization verification
  as part of the application process.

### Information we collect automatically **when you use our services**

When you use our mobile app, we collect information about how you’ve used it. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Post, saw a specific content for a certain period of time, and made or published a few Mixes. Here’s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:

- **Log information:** Like most online service
  providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP
  address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network
  information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for
  example, when you create or make changes to your contents in the mobile app.
- **Usage information:** We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we collect information about
  the actions that users perform — in other words, who did what and when (e.g., [username] deleted “[title of post]” at
  [time/date]). We also collect
  information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page
  views, search queries you submit and other parts of our Services) along with information about your
  device (e.g., hardware model, operating system version and device memory). We use this information to, for example, provide our
  Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can
  make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.
- **Location information:** We may determine the
  approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit
  our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect
  information about your precise location via our mobile app (like when
  you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do
  so through your mobile device operating system’s permissions.
- **Camera and Microphone:** Many of our services require us to collect
  videos and other information from your device’s camera, microphone and photos. For
  example, you won’t be able to create contents from your
  phone unless we can access your camera or photos.
- **Stored information:** We may access information
  stored on your mobile device via our mobile app. We access this stored
  information through your device operating system’s permissions. For
  example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your
  mobile device’s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored
  on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the
  sunrise to your website.
- **Information from cookies & other technologies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
  computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each
  time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. We may use cookies
  and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track
  visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as
  track and understand email campaign effectiveness.

### Information we get from third parties

We may also get information about you from other sources. For example:

- **Third Party Login:** If you create or log in to your
  Reveality account through another service (like Google) we’ll
  receive associated login information (e.g. a connection token, your
  username, your email address)
- **Social Sharing Services:** If you connect your
  website or account to a social media service, we’ll receive information from that service (e.g.,
  your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the
  authorization procedures for that service.

The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.

## How and Why we use your information

### Purposes for Using Information

We use information about you for the purposes listed below:

- **To provide our Services.** For example, to set up and maintain your account, create AR experiences, backup and restore your
  content, provide customer service, process payments, and
  verify user information.
- **To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.** For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our
  Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users
  interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think
  our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites
  more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.
- **To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.** For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the
  results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a
  paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and
  forecasting user retention.
- **To protect our Services, our users, and the public.** For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting
  against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting
  spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights
  and property of Reveality and others, which may result in us, for
  example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.
- **To fix problems with our Services.** For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.
- **To customize the user experience.** For example, to
  personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and
  advertisements for our Services, recommending content through our post suggestions, and providing new contents and features for your usage pleasure.
- **To communicate with you.** For example, by emailing
  you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Reveality; or calling you to share offers and promotions that we
  think will be of interest to you. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out,
  we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)
- **To recruit and hire new Reveality employees.** For example, by evaluating job applicants and communicating with them.

## Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information

A note here for those in the European Union about our
legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data
protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on
the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our
commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other
agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for
example, in order to enable access to our creation tools on your device or
charge you for a paid plan; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance
with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect
your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) We have a
legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide
and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer
you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to
communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness
of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition;
to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to
personalize your experience; or (5) You have given us your consent — for
example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and
analyze them later on.

## Sharing Information

### How We Share Information

We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy. These are spelled out below :

- **Third-party vendors:** We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to
  provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, cloud storage services, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you,); those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns,
  and by placing ads to market our services); those that help us
  understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); and other third-party
  tools that help us manage operations. We require vendors to agree
  to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.
- **Legal and regulatory requirements:** We may disclose
  information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other
  governmental request.
- **To protect rights, property, and others:** We may
  disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that
  disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
  Reveality, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we
  have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or
  serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
- **Business transfers:** In connection with any merger,
  sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
  business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Reveality
  goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
  If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would
  continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your
  information may continue to use your information, but only consistent
  with this Privacy Policy.
- **With your consent:** We may share and disclose
  information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may
  share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do
  so, like when you connect your app or share content to social medias through our services.
- **Aggregated or de-identified information:** We may
  share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it
  can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may
  publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a
  hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad
  campaigns on other platforms.
- **Published support requests:** If you send us a
  request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our
  other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.

**We have a policy that we do not sell our users' data.** We aren't a data broker, we don't sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don't sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.

### Information Shared Publicly

Information that you choose to make public is — you
guessed it — disclosed publicly. That means information like your public
profile, posts, other content that you make public, and
your “Likes” and comments on other posts are all available to others
— and we hope they get a lot of views!

Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.

## How Long We Keep Information

We generally discard information about you when it’s no
longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it —
described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and
we’re not legally required to keep it. For example, when you delete a post, Mix, or comment
from your account, we may retain it in your Trash folder for up to thirty
days in case you change your mind and would like to restore that
content, because starting from scratch is no fun. After the thirty days
are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until
purged. After that, it will be permanently deleted.

## Security

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard
to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use,
alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We
monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Choices

You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

- **Limit the information that you provide:** If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account
  information, profile information, and transaction and billing
  information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this
  information, certain features of our Services may not be accessible.
- **Limit access to information on your mobile device:**
  Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the option
  to discontinue our ability to access your camera or collect stored information via our mobile apps. If you choose to limit this, you may
  not be able to use certain features, such as creating new content.
- **Opt out of marketing communications:** You may opt
  out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the
  instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of
  promotional communications, we may still send you other communications,
  like those about your account and legal notices.
- **Set your browser to reject cookies:** At this time, Reveality does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Reveality’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Reveality’s websites may not function properly without the aid of
  cookies.
- **Opt out of our internal analytics program:** You can
  do this through your user settings. By opting out, you will stop sharing information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while you’re logged in to your Reveality account.
- **Close your account:** While we’d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services. Please
  keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after
  closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above — for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply
  with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law
  enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business
  interests.

## Your Rights

If you are located in certain parts of the world,
including California and countries that fall under the scope of the
European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the “GDPR”), you may
have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right
to request access to or deletion of your data.

### European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR*)*

If you are located in a country that falls under the scope
of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect
to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law,
including the rights to:

- Request access to your personal data;
- Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
- Object to our use and processing of your personal data;
- Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and
- Request portability of your personal data.

You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.

### California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us
to provide California residents with some additional information about
the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we
get that personal information, and how and why we use it. The CCPA also
requires us to provide a list of the “categories” of personal
information we collect, as that term is defined in the law, so, here it
is. In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of
personal information from California residents, depending on the
Services used:

- Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);
- Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);
- Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us);
- Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as
  your usage of our Services);
- Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);
- Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);
- Professional or employment-related information (for example, information you provide in a job application); and
- Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).

You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the Information We Collect section above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How and Why We Use Information section. And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the Sharing Information section.
If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the
CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the right
to:

- Request to know the categories of personal information we collect,
  the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and
  using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces
  of information we collect about you;
- Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;
- Opt out of any sale of personal information; and
- Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.

## Contacting Us About These Rights

You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal
data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you
aren’t able to or you’d like to contact us about one of the other
rights, [contact us](mailto:contact@reveality.io).

When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we’ll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you
are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address
associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent
to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We
may still require you to verify your identity with us.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Reveality
may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage
visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy
Policy. Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be
subject to the updated policy.
