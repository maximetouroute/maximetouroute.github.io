Each frame contains a secret. Passersby are invited to take their phone and aim at the frame with the camera. The artwork appears through the screen, in Augmented Reality.

Photography, paintings, videos, sounds and 3Dâ€¦ Each frame transforms in a live painting telling us a bit more about art, culture, and the location's heritage.
