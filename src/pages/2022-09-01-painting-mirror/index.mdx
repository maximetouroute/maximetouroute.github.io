<br/>


__Painting Mirror__ is an interactive videomapping in which the audience is photographed and re-projeted in the style of famous painters (or illustrators, drawers, ...).
Participants can take a picture of the projected wall or get a printed or digital copy of their stylised picture. 
Styles are originally created by an Artificial Inteligence developed for the project. Styles are created for the event context or current exhibitions.
