<br/>

__Painting Mirror__ is an interactive videomapping where audience photos are projected 
and transformed in the style of great artists (painting, street art, drawing). The styles are generated by Artificial Intelligence. 
The installation adapts to each presentation to use artists' styles related to the event and locality. 
The installation allows for the valorization of local creative heritage in an accessible manner while raising awareness about the uses 
of Artificial Intelligence.

## How it works

The audience is invited to share their photos. They appear live on the projection to form a large gallery of original paintings. 
This transformation is done by our Artificial Intelligence capable of analyzing existing paintings and reproducing their style.

We adapt the picture taking process to the crowd and context :
* photo booth
* photographers in the crowd
* website accessible to the public to share photos autonomously

## During the event

Audiences find themselves in a large gallery of projected paintings. 
They share their photos and enjoy finding them. The atmosphere is friendly, and many take photos of the projection as a souvenir.

The artistic team come on-site to interact with the public, assist with photography, animate the projection and explain how Artificial Intelligence works to the curious.

If participants share their photos themselves, we conduct strict moderation with our moderation tool.

There is no participants limit: everyone can participate at the same time.

## Highlighting local artists

We collaborate with local museums and artists to design style transformations inspired by their works. 
The setup is a new way to valorize creative heritage by allowing the public to take posession of pictorial styles.
