## Powered by [Audio Broadcaster](/audio-broadcaster)

Listening to a podcast on a hike can be challenging without a Spotify subscription or the right app. To make this project accessible and user-friendly, we designed a simple web page accessible via a QR code at the car park.

Since the signal can be unreliable along this trail, we created a web page that **works offline**:
* Load the page once, and all audio content is downloaded.
* You can close the page and reopen it anytime during the hike.
* When reopening or refreshing the page, it functions like a normal website — but **without requiring a network connection**.
