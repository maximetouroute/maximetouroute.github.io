Immersive performance interpreted by a storyteller, a musician, and an illustrator.
The audience contributes to the development of the story with: digital tools, discussions, reflections...

The goal is for each spectator to come out with the feeling of being able to contribute through their experience and imagination to a more optimistic and joyful future.
