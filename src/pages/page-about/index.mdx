# Bio 

__Maxime Touroute is an artist exploring spaces where technology and humanity intersect.__

His work investigates how our most human traits—creativity, interaction, and togetherness—are reshaped by the digital age. Through participatory and immersive experiences, Maxime invites audiences to reflect on the connections that unite us in a world shaped by technology.

His first work, *Let’s Draw* *(80+ exhibitions, 10 countries)*, transforms public spaces into massive, interactive canvases, inviting participants to draw together in real time through projection mapping. By harnessing technology to amplify collective creation, *Let’s Draw* unveils shared and collective imaginaries of themes that resonate universally : how to draw a tree, how to draw love, how to draw our world?

His latest piece, *The Invisible Party (co-author Natacha Paquignon, co-produced by Enter Art Fair), is a Mixed Reality dance performance where dancers interacts with a virtual representation of themselves, exploring liminal spaces - the connections between body, space, and technology, as well as the interplay of visible and invisible realms. Can a digital world heighten awareness of our physical human presence?*

Each of Maxime’s projects is powered by creative software he develops in-house. His dedication to making digital creation more accessible drives him to share his tools and expertise with a broad community of actors, from artists to cultural institutions. By breaking down technical barriers, he engages in cross-disciplinary collaborations with dancers, theater makers, musicians, illustrators, and more. Over the years, this approach has led him to the creation of hybrid artistic forms and a creative software company.

Maxime’s software is currently used in numerous artworks distributed internationally but also repurposed by museums, festivals and cultural institutions for immersive experiences, cultural mediation, cultural outreach and accessibility. His tools include *Revy*, an all-in-one solution for Augmented Reality creations; *Audio Broadcaster*, enabling seamless real-time audio transmission to an audience; and *Live-maker*, a platform that facilitates large-scale public interaction through smartphones.

Maxime’s artistic vision and engagement have been rewarded by numerous international tours, talks and awards including two entrepreneurship “Pépite” awards from the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research.

Through his art, tools, and philosophy of sharing, Maxime uses technology to foster human connections, bringing artists, audiences, and simply, people closer.
