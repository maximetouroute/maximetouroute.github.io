## Description

We all start somewhere. I've worked on many creative projects during my studies, small ones and big ones. They all resulted in creations sometimes good, sometimes terrible, but always were a lot of fun to make and great lessons for the future. They forged my passion and skills for what I now do every day.

**_True Pedestrian_** is one of those projects.  
A spoof trailer of the excellent TV show [True Detective](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2356777/), made with **Vincent Montalieu**.

#### Role

**Camera & Sound Operator**, **Comedian**.
