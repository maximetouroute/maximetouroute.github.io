### — I'm Maxime, engineer specialised in **audiovisual arts**

Passionate by cinema, photography and visual arts, I love to work on projects in which my creativity and technical skills can be an asset. I'm well versed in **film making** from shooting to post-production. Being a full fledged engineer I specialise on **audiovisual technologies and software development**. I'm not afraid to learn cutting-edge technologies to open up new creative possibilities.

I'm always open to new projects
