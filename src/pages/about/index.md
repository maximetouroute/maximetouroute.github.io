### — I'm Maxime, an engineer specialised in __audiovisual arts__


I've always been drawn by film making, photography and arts. I'm well versed in many skills around audiovisual creation, from shooting to post-production. I'm also a full fledged software engineer and using these skills to design new creative experiences. 
I love to work on audiovisual and art projects where my creativity and rigor can be an asset.
 
I'm always looking for new projects — if you would like to make something together, [get in touch !](/contact)

## — What I do

#### I make movies
I direct short movies and I join movie crews as a camera operator, camera assistant, or sound engineer during shooting, as a colorist or sound mixer during post.

#### I work on any kind of creative projects
Photography, video, museography, digital arts... If it's creative, I'm in for it !

#### And I code
Web apps, software, mobile apps... With my experience as a software engineer I design workflows to gain on productivity and I develop innovative solutions for art projects.
