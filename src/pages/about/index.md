I've always been drawn by cinema, photography and arts. I'm well versed in film making from shooting to post-production. Being a full fledged software engineer I use these skills to design new creative experiences.

#### I make movies

I direct short movies and I join movie crews as a camera operator, camera assistant, or sound engineer during shooting, as a colorist or sound mixer during post.

#### I work on any kind of creative projects

Cinema, photography, digital arts... If it's creative, I'm in for it !
