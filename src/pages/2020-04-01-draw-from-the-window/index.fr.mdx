During lockdown in France we designed a decentralised videoprojection installation to bring art at the doorstep of residential areas. People all over France were able to exhibit our [Live Drawing Installation](https://thelivedrawingproject.com) from their window without prior knowledge in videomapping.

Drawings traveled between locations connecting people and creating a **collective artwork evolving with upcoming drawings**. More than **9500 drawings** were made by **560 participants** in **30 locations** across **10 cities** simultaneously.
