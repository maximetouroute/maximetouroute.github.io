Decentralised videoprojection system to bring art at the doorstep of residential areas during lockdowns. People all over the world can take their living room projector and project the [Live Drawing Installation](https://thelivedrawingproject.com) from their window without prior knowledge in videomapping.

Everyone on the planet can draw and drawings get projected on every projector in real time. Drawings travel between locations connecting people and creating a **collective artwork evolving with upcoming drawings**.

During French lockdown in April 2020, more than **9500 drawings** were made by **560 participants** in **30 locations & 10 cities** simultaneously.

The lockdown initiative got awarded a _Pepite des Pepites 2020_ prize by the French ministry of innovation.
