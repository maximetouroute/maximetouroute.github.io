## Exhibition

The Humanlapse project has ben selected for exhibition by the Lyon City Hall.

Exhibition from __21st of November until the 13rd of December__ at _Mairie de Lyon 9, Lyon, France_



## Scenography

For this exhibition, I've built digital photo frames each one looping a single humanlapse video. 
The frames are fully autonomous. They turn on in the morning and turn off in the evening without the need of any human intervention. 
The frames are fixed on poles and disposed in an open area so visitors can walk around each humanlapse.
