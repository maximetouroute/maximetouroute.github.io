_La Bulle_ is an interactive photo wall project developed to create bonds in the workplace and other spaces. It's inspired by the wooden panels where people like to share news and postcards.
Participants can send pictures and messages from their phone at any time. Shared contents appear on a projected wall in one or multiple locations. The projection helps people to discover their colleagues and create bonds in their common space but also accross multiple locations. The project was unveiled in the presence of the First Lady Brigitte Macron.
