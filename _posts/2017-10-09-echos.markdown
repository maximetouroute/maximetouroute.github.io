__*Echos*__ is a very short movie made for a student contest in 24h.

* __Clermont Ferrand jury's congratulations__, 2017

* Role on this project: __Director__, __Film maker__

__Insight__ :
This short movie was shot in one hour at dawn, and the shooting got stopped by the police despite our small crew (2 persons), so we couldn't shoot the end. We decided to edit and publish the movie anyway and received the __Clermont-Ferrand jury's congratulations__ for it.
